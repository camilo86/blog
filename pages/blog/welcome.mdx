Hey there!

I bought this domain almost 2 years ago, and to be honest, I have yet to host anything interesting here.

Back in 2020, I purchased `camilo86.dev` with the hopes that I would finally get my blog up and running. To be fair, I did end up posting a blog or two back then. I guess it was something to be entertained with during the covid times.

As the covid restrictions eased, and school open up again, I got busy with things and didn't pay much attention to this site. Some time during early 2021, I ended up dropping the site, and instead, used the domain to test some projects I was working at the time.

Fast forward to now (December 2022), I realized that I should probably bring all my work into a single place place. So thats how we get this post ðŸ˜‰. So in this post, I'm now:

1. Sharing a bit of history of this domain
2. Announcing I'm back to blogging and posting my work online
3. Probably the most important one: testing this site using this as my very first post (after all, I'm building this from scratch, so I hope it all works ðŸ¤£)

Well there it is, see ya on the next real post
